# Synchronization Plan for Client and Challan Functionalities

## Plan:
1. **Client Component Updates**:
   - Ensure that any changes made to the client data (add, edit, delete) are immediately reflected in the local storage.
   - Implement a mechanism to notify the `EditChallan` component when a client is added or updated, so that the dropdown in the challan form is always up-to-date.

2. **Challan Component Updates**:
   - Modify the `EditChallan` component to ensure that when a client is selected from the dropdown, the corresponding client data is fetched and displayed correctly.
   - Ensure that any updates to the challan data are also saved back to local storage, maintaining consistency.

3. **Data Synchronization**:
   - Implement a shared state or context to manage the client and challan data, allowing both components to access and update the same data source.
   - Ensure that the client selection in the challan form reflects the latest client data, including any changes made in the client component.

4. **Testing**:
   - After implementing the changes, thoroughly test the synchronization between the client and challan functionalities to ensure that all features work as expected without any issues.

## Follow-up Steps:
- Verify the changes in the files.
- Confirm with the user for any additional requirements or modifications.
